# Task1
Task 1 done via tutorials available as i wanted to get familiar with the syntax of python and its concepts as i had zero experience in the language
Task 2 was done by me mostly, i did use AI engines to debug it in certain places and really understand what the research paper wanted us to implemen.However I am still not sure about if i have done it exactly how the paper wanted, as it doesnt resolve conflicts by recursive calls rather by checking pairs of agent conflicts over all agents at once

The Astarr.py has the normal A* visualization, Astarr10.py has the CBS implemented visualization
